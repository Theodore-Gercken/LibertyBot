# LibertyBot 2.0
In addition, LibertyBot 2.0 is currently under Beta Development. LibertyBot 2.0 will consist of an upgraded generic application that will be free to use and custom applications that will cost $3 a month (strictly for hosting costs) that will integrate custom server management features (such as a starboard, logging, Twitter account following, reaction roles, etc.). You can request a custom application from Theodore Gercken at t.gercken@lpac.us.

# Usage
Use the prefix `-` before any commands. (ex: `-events` for events).

Information on all the commands can be found through the `-info` command.

# Donate
Making LibertyBot available to everyone 24/7 costs money, so if you want to help out to make sure it keeps existing, feel free to donate to the patreon! [https://www.patreon.com/libertybot](https://www.patreon.com/libertybot)
