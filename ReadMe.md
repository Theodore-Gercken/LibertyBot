# LibertyBot 
LibertyBot is a community service project created by Theodore Gercken for libertarian discord servers. It provides free access to libertarian informational commands that can make any libertarian discord server stand out to anyone who wants to use it! This is currently the second version of the application. You can Invite LibertyBot [here](https://top.gg/bot/853455948848300043)

# LibertyBot Custom Applications
In addition, LibertyBot custom applications are currently under Beta Development. Custom Applications cost $3 a month (strictly for hosting costs) and integrate custom server management features (such as a starboard, logging, Twitter account following, reaction roles, etc.). You can request a custom application from Theodore Gercken at t.gercken@lpac.us.
